## How to use RYS Management? 

Let's say your rys is called `my_rys` and you are storing key  `my_value`. 

1. First of all you have to view template

Inside your rys create `app/views/rys_management/plugins/_my_rys.html.erb`. This file is automatically created if plugin was generated by rys >= 1.1

```ruby
<p>
  <%= form.label :my_value %>
  <%= form.text_field :my_value %>
</p>
```

2. Accessing 

You can access it via plugin
```ruby
MyRys.setting(:my_value)
MyRys.set_setting(:my_value, VALUE)
```
or with direct access.
```ruby
EasySetting.value(:my_rys_my_value)
EasySetting.find_by(name: 'my_rys_my_value')
```
