# Tools and support

*In this article we will look closer at tools used in Easy Software and where you can get support.*

---

There is a wide variety of tools used in Easy Software. Some are used on a daily basis and you need to have access to them, some are used less often or could be never used by you.

Here goes the list of the tools used and what department takes care of it:
- Common tools - back-office can help you get access
    - [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/) - instant messaging tool
    - Outlook email - email service
    - Easy Project - our own instance of our own product
    - [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/download/) - password management tool
- Quality assurance - ask QA team
    - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - tool for automated testing
- DevOps tools - ask operations' team
    - [Easy Git](https://git.easy.cz/) - Easy Software git
    - [Gitmakers](https://gitmakers.com/) - package manager
    - [Bugsnag](https://app.bugsnag.com/organizations/easy-software/stability-center) - error monitoring and stability management tool
    - [Hookdeck](https://dashboard.hookdeck.io/) - webhook management tool
    - [New relic](https://one.eu.newrelic.com/) - performance monitoring tool
    - VPN - VPN for internal network
- Internal development
    - [EasyCLI](https://git.easy.cz/internal/easy_cli) - internal tool for developers
    - [Nodes](https://nodes.easysoftware.com) - package management tool
    - [Gems](http://gems.easysoftware.com) - gems management tool

For Microsoft services (Teams and Outlook email) you will need to have a Microsoft account - if you do not have one yet, reach out to the backoffice team.

General rule of thumb is to reach out to respective team and ask for access.


### MS Teams channel for help from developers
The channel to look for in MS Teams is [Developers help](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a6c2718cc2fea4e8a974a29b0636c684e%40thread.tacv2/Developers%2520help). Head here if you need deeper technical insight.
