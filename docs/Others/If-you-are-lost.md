## Communication channels

Over here you can see the official ways we communicate and where you can contact us if you need anything. 

### Internal communication

We are using [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/) as a primary channel for internal communication. It is not just for developers, but the entire company uses it. 

Login the Teams using your Microsoft credentials. Feel free to use desktop application as well as mobile app. 

> If you need help from developers use the [Developers help](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a6c2718cc2fea4e8a974a29b0636c684e%40thread.tacv2/Developers%2520help) channel.

## Advanced technical support

This service alternates between ruby developers. You can see current schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-tPsULFeCNVvff7sMwbDfJ40bkWIi5vp8y3upBR6XOs/edit#gid=1253558721).

People who are on duty have to: 

I. Check and respond to chat, especially on channel [Developers help](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a6c2718cc2fea4e8a974a29b0636c684e%40thread.tacv2/Developers%2520help). This is one of biggest responsibility. 

II. Follows [Support help](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ac1a8720bfef54fda996d90e02c3381aa%40thread.tacv2/Support%2520Help) channel and tries to help.

IV. Monitors and solves bugs from *bugsnag*:
  1. Close rare case (and these, which are connected with application restart)
  2. Reassingns non-critical bugs to [Vendula KreuzovÃ¡](https://es.easyproject.com/users/2237/profile) (so the team can go through them during bug meeting on every Tuesday)
  3. Critical bugs - make sure they are fixed (solve on your own, process them, delegate them,...)
