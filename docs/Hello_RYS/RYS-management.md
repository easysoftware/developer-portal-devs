## How to use RYS Management? 

Let's say your rys is called `my_rys` and you are storing key `my_value`. 

1. First you have to view template

Inside your rys create a new file `app/views/rys_management/plugins/_my_rys.html.erb`. This file is automatically created if plugin was generated by `rys` >= 1.1

```html
<p>
  <%= form.label :my_value %>
  <%= form.text_field :my_value %>
</p>
```

2. Next you have to access the template via plugin or using direct access

```Plugin
MyRys.setting(:my_value)
MyRys.set_setting(:my_value, VALUE)
```
```Direct
EasySetting.value(:my_rys_my_value)
EasySetting.find_by(name: 'my_rys_my_value')
```
