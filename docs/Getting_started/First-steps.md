## Workspace and workstation

At the beginning, you have to setup your workspace with generics: 

1. Encrypt your hard drive.
2. Use keyring service ([bitwarden](https://es.easyproject.com/easy_knowledge_stories/1419) is in the progress for company use).
3. Install Email client (example of setting for [thunderbird](https://es.easyproject.com/easy_knowledge_stories/909) or [outlook](https://es.easyproject.com/easy_knowledge_stories/1358).
4. Install chat client.
5. Prepare for backend and/or frontend development. You can read about it more in this article.
6. Install [***EasyCLI***](https://git.easy.cz/internal/easy_cli) (highly recommended). Shortens the amount of clicks you have to do. For example, it automatically creates merge requests, simplifies SSH access, etc...
